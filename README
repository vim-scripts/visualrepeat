DESCRIPTION
This plugin defines repetition of Vim built-in normal mode commands via .
for visual mode. Additionally, it offers functions like the popular repeat.vim
plugin that allow mappings to be repeated in visual mode, too.

VISUAL MODE REPETITION
This extends the built-in normal mode repeat . to visual mode.

VISUAL MODE MAPPING REPETITION
Like with repeat.vim for normal mode, visual mode mappings can register a
<Plug> mapping to be used for visual mode repetition.

Likewise, normal mode mappings can (in addition to the repeat.vim registration
of a normal mode mapping) register a visual mode mapping with visualrepeat.vim
that will be repeated in visual mode.

Operator-pending mappings end with g@ and repeat naturally; i.e. Vim
re-applies the 'opfunc' on the equivalent text (but at the current cursor
position). But without a call to repeat#set(), it is impossible to repeat this
operator-pending mapping to the current visual selection. Plugins cannot call
repeat#set() in their operator-pending mapping, because then Vim's built-in
repeat would be circumvented, the full mapping ending with g@ would be
re-executed, and the repetition would then wait for the {motion}, what is not
wanted.
Therefore, this plugin offers a separate visualrepeat#set() function that can
be invoked for operator-pending mappings. It can also be invoked for
normal-mode mappings that have already called repeat#set(), and may override
that mapping with a special repeat mapping for visual mode repeats. Together
with the remapped {Visual}. command, this allows repetition - similar to what
the built-in Vim commands do - across normal, operator-pending and visual
mode.

SOURCE
- Based on vimtip #1142, Repeat last command and put cursor at start of change
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Repeat_last_command_and_put_cursor_at_start_of_change
- The client interface and implementation has been based on repeat.vim
  (vimscript #2136) by Tim Pope.

RELATED WORKS
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) has been the basis for this plugin and should
  be used in conjunction with visualrepeat.vim. (Otherwise, you'd have visual
  mode repeat, but no repeat in normal mode.)

USAGE
{Visual}.               Repeat last change in all visually selected lines.
                        - characterwise: Start from cursor position.
                        - linewise: Each line separately, starting from first column.
                        - blockwise: Not supported.

                        Note: If the last normal mode command included a
                        {motion} (e.g. g~e), the repetition will also move
                        exactly over this {motion}, NOT the visual selection!
                        It is thus best to repeat commands that work on the
                        entire line (e.g. g~$).
